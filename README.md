This project is the first phase in the development of a low cost, portable, medical monitoring system. The current phase focuses on the design and development of the basic system architecture, modeling the instrumentation, establishing the high-level control flow, and managing the basic switching operations, display, and alarm and warning annunciation functions. The initial deliverables include the high-level system architecture, the ability to perform a subset of the necessary control, and portions of the display and annunciation components.  Subsequent phases will continue to evolve the system architecture and flow of control, extend the driver development, and incorporate additional capabilities into both the measurement and display subsystems.  The final subsystem must be capable collecting data from several different types of sensors, processing the data from those sensors, displaying it locally, and then transmitting it over a local area network to a collection management station.   
In developing such a system, we will, 1. Introduce formal specifications
2. Introduce and work with formal design methodologies such as UML - Use Cases, Functional Decomposition, Sequence Diagrams, State Charts, and Data and Control Flow Diagrams. 
. Work with the C language. 
4. Develop and build your background on C pointers, the passing of pointers to subroutines, and manipulating them in your subroutines. 
5. Introduce simple tasks and a task queue. 
6. Share data between tasks. 
7. Use software delay/timing functions. 
8. Use basic output operations. 

Prerequisites: 
Familiarity with C programming, the Arduino UNO and ATMega 2560 microcomputers, and the accompanying Arduino development environment (IDE).
